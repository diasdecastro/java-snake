# Java Snake

Welcome to my Java Snake game! I built this project, because I wanted have a hands-on experience building a GUI using Java
as well as building a highly interactive system that uses threads to manipulate the exacution of code that runs continuously in real time.

# Instructions

Snake Movement:

**W = up** \
**A = left** \

**D = right** 

After "Game Over" press Space to restart the game.
